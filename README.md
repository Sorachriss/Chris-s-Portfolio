## Project 1
## Predictive Hotel Review Analysis Competitetion Overview 
- Collaborated in developing a predictive model using Excel and Python's scikit-learn to forecast Las Vegas hotel review scores for amenity optimization.
- Developed Tableau visualizations to illustrate amenity trends among top- and bottom-rated hotels, reinforcing model insights.
- Employed Excel and Python to scrape over 1,000 hotel reviews, ensuring a robust dataset for analysis.
- Competed in an Alteryx-hosted challenge with over 70 participants, demonstrating advanced analytical skills.
- Applied regression analysis techniques to accurately predict dependent variable outcomes based on independent variables.
  
  ## Code and Resources
- Conducted regression analysis using Python to derive actionable insights.
- Utilized Excel for data cleaning to support efficient Alteryx workflows.
- Developed and maintained interactive Tableau dashboards for comprehensive data visualization.

## Our Analysis 
- Utilized Alteryx to develop workflows that provided data-driven insights into team performance, enabling role-based analysis to measure effectiveness and optimize operations.

- Based On Linear Regression we did on python we discovery what amenties should hotels priotzie in order to ensure the highest review.

- While we were data cleaning we narrow down to Hotel name, # amenities, Average score, Spa, Casino, Free Interent, and top 3 Amenities.
- After Analysis we noticed with the top 5 hotles that were doing well was having around 5 amentites compare to the other amounts of amentites they had.

- We also saw that hotels with higher reviews and scores had specfic amenties such as Casino, Free Internet, Spa. Others that had these and extras places were a plus such as Tennis Court and Pool.

##  Hotels should prioritize these amenities (in order):
- Free Internet
- Casino
- Spa
- Pool
- Tennis Court
- Gym (negative effect)




### What was our Objective: How can hotels predict a Tripadvisor review, and what amenities should hotels prioritize in order to ensure the highest review?
### Answer: Hotels offering five key amenities—prioritizing free internet, a spa, and a casino—tended to receive higher reviews on TripAdvisor. To predict higher review counts and ratings, these specific amenities were identified as essential, with hotels like Wynn, The Venetian, and Encore scoring the highest.

## Project 2 
 ### Alzheimer’s Diagnosis Predictive Modeling Overview 
- Led a team in utilizing Excel for data analysis and predictive modeling, applying Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Regression Trees to identify key factors for early Alzheimer’s diagnosis. 
- Developed Regression Trees using XLMiner to visually highlight critical variables for early detection.
- Identifying which variables are the most significant when diagnosing a patient with alzheimer's.

DataSet:
- [Alzheimer’s Disease Data from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninadaithal/imagesoasis)
- 33 Variables and 2150 Records
- Decision variable: Diagnosis
- Classification
