## Project 1
## Predictive Hotel Review Analysis Competitetion Overview 
- Collaborated on developing a predictive model using Excel and Python's scikit-learn to forecast Las Vegas hotel review scores for amenity optimization.
- Created Tableau visualizations to highlight amenity trends in top- and bottom-rated hotels, reinforcing insights from the model.
- Scraped over 1000 reviews was given through excel and python.
- Competed in an Alteryx-hosted challenge with over 70 participants.
- Predict the value of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
  
  ## Code and Resources
- Use Regression analysis through Python
- Excel for Data cleaning for Alteryx workflow
- Tableau for data visualization with dashboards

## Our Analysis 
- Utilized Alteryx to develop workflows that provided data-driven insights into team performance, enabling role-based analysis to measure effectiveness and optimize operations.

### Based On Linear Regression we did on python we discovery what amenties should hotels priotzie in order to ensure the highest review.

### What was our Objective: How can hotels predict a Tripadvisor review, and what amenities should hotels prioritize in order to ensure the highest review?







### Alzheimer’s Diagnosis Predictive Modeling
Led a team in utilizing Excel for data analysis and predictive modeling, applying Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Regression Trees to identify key factors for early Alzheimer’s diagnosis. Developed Regression Trees using XLMiner to visually highlight critical variables for early detection.
