description: What motivates me most is the opportunity to continuously learn, grow, and make a meaningful impact through data-driven decision-making. Having recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Business Administration, concentrating in Business Analytics, from California State University, Fullerton, Iâ€™ve developed a strong passion for leveraging data to uncover insights and drive strategic outcomes. This motivation extended beyond academics during my time as the Vice President of Business and Data Analytics for a university club, where I led a team in analyzing data to optimize operations and ensure every initiative was backed by evidence. Seeing how my work directly influenced results and empowered others was incredibly rewarding and further fueled my commitment to analytics.

Leadership remains a key driver of my motivation. During my time as Vice President of Professional Development for the American Marketing Association, I had the opportunity to mentor peers and collaborate on initiatives to foster professional growth and innovation. These experiences sharpened my leadership and time management skills, which I continue to refine as I advance in my career. Outside of my professional pursuits, I find balance and creativity in activities like basketball, volleyball, and photography. These personal passions help me stay motivated, energized, and focused, as I strive to make a positive impact in the field of business analytics.
